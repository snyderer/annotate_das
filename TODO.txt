GUI TO DO:
-Denoising 
	- Gabor filters? (probably not)
Thoughts on GUI improvements for Blue whales:
-Select "c_min" and "c_max" values for narrowing in on calls
-allow for upward or downward propagation only to more easily isolate sounds
-Select bandwidth to isolate specific call types
-(more complicated) select f-x and spectrogram plots first, and built TX contours from those	-
